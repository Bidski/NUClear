        /**
         * @brief
         *  This is used to monitor a type/group of task/s.  If the monitored task/s have not occurred within a desired
         *  timeframe, the watchdog can be serviced to trigger a specified reaction.
         *
         * @details
         *  This is a useful tool for anything in the system which might stall, and needs to be kick-started.  The
         *  watchdog can be instructed to watch either a single task, or group of tasks, over a period of time. If no
         *  activity is detected after the specified timeframe, the reaction associated with the watchdog will be
         *  triggered.
         * @code on<Watchdog<SampleReactor, 10, std::chrono::milliseconds>>() @endcode
         *  In the example above, all reactions from the SampleReactor will be monitored.  If a task associated with the
         *  SampleReactor has not occurred for 10 milliseconds,  the watchdog will be serviced.  When the watchdog is
         *  serviced, the timer re-sets.
         *
         * @attention
         *  When working with watchdog, it needs to be serviced by a watchdog service emission:
         *  @code  emit(std::make_unique<NUClear::message::ServiceWatchdog<SampleReactor>>()) @endcode
         *  This emission should use the same template type as the watchdog.  Each time this emission occurs, the
         *  watchdog timer will be reset.
         *
         * @attention
         *  The period which is used to measure the ticks must be greater than or equal to clock::duration or the
         *  program will not compile.
         *
         * @par Implements
         *  Bind, Get
         *
         * @tparam TWatchdog
         *  the type/group of tasks the watchdog will track
         * @tparam ticks
         *  the number of ticks of a particular type to wait
         * @tparam period
         *  A type of duration (e.g. std::chrono::seconds) to measure the ticks in.  This will default to clock
         *  duration, but can accept any of the defined std::chrono durations (nanoseconds, microseconds, milliseconds,
         *  seconds, minutes, hours).  Note that you can also define your own unit:  See
         *  http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/duration
