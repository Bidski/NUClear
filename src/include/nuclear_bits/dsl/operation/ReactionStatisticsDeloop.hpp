         * @brief Prevent recursive looping when using the ReactionStatistics system
         *
         * @details When utilising the ReactionStatistics system there exists an issue in that the reaction that
         *          uses the reaction statistics system will itself generate reaction statistics. This causes an
         *          infinite loop in the system that will eventually cause a stack overflow and crash. To avoid this
         *          this type overloads the method and prevents reactions that use ReactionStatistics from creating
         *          them.
